# MedContour

## Project Description:
Objective: Develop a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for automatic contour annotation on medical images. Users can mark key points on the image by clicking, and the software will automatically generate and display the contour based on these key points.

## Main Features:
### Interactive Annotation
Users can click on key points through the GUI to mark specific locations on the image.
### Automatic Contour Generation
The software uses an optimization algorithm to generate contour lines based on the user-marked key points.
### Real-time Display
The contour dynamically updates in the user interface, providing visual feedback.


## Existing packages
### Image Processing Libraries
    OpenCV
    scikit-image

### GUI Frameworks
    Pyqt5
